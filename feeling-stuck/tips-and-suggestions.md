# Tips and Suggestions

* Enterprise grade servers can be bought second hand on Ebay for a lot cheaper
* You don't need enterprise grade equipment to run a nodeRyzen 7, 32GB ram, at least 500 GB NVMe should be enough to run something
* Most second hand servers come without rails and front disk pockets. You will need both
* Some servers require extra cables, such as NVMe extenders or similar. Make sure to check that out first
* [Awesome YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@cloudninjas) to watch and learn before you buy anything
* All servers need power supply. Research UPSs, PDUs, surge protectors and other similar devices to protect and power your equipment
* Modular setups are more resilient. For example small networking devices can greatly benefit from an additional offline UPS, powering only that particular device
* Servers have 2 power supplies for a reason. Ideally each one should be connected to a different input source
* Think of powering networking devices, with an alternative input supply. If the power goes down, the nodes wont work without the network.&#x20;
* Automation (use existing software to ease your life)
* Use open source tools. Find a [list here](resources.md)
* Design cable management and your space in advance
* Servers make noise. Be prepared. They also produce heat. You need to think about it in advance
* "Do not put public and private (nodes) infrastructure in one basket". Your public endpoints should be separated networks
* Physical security is as important as digital. Ideally, the server room should have 24/7 security, and limited physical access
* Learn to read logs, don't guess. Learn to use packet tracing. Don't guess. Learn to monitor your nodes. Don't guess
