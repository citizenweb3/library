# Wake up, Neo...

Welcome, brave adventurer, to a new era of decentralization. You stand at a crossroads, much like Neo when he was offered a choice. You can continue to rent servers from centralized data centers, relying on third-party providers to manage your nodes... or you can take the red pill, seize control of your infrastructure, and join the ranks of those who dare to operate on bare metal.

### Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.

In a galaxy far, far away, relying on the Cloud was convenient, but it was also the path to the Dark Side. True decentralization means having physical access to your own hardware, owning your setup, and knowing it inside out. Whether you're battling for the freedom of the galaxy or the integrity of the blockchain, every validator's node is a fortress that must be secured by its rightful owner. By choosing to run your own hardware, you become the Luke Skywalker of decentralization, guiding the future of a truly distributed networking.

### One ring to rule them all? Not today!

In the realm of cloud providers, one ring, one data center, one point of failure can bring the entire network down. But not in this world. Here, we break away from the centralized control, dispersing power across many hands, many locations, and many nodes. As a baremetal validator, you are the keeper of your own keys, your own infrastructure. Like Frodo, the power is in your hands, but instead of casting it away, you wield it to ensure the network's resilience and security.

### It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door...

And yet, that's where the adventure truly begins. Setting up and maintaining your own validator hardware can be challenging, but that's what makes it worthwhile. Just as Bilbo left the comfort of his hobbit hole for an adventure of a lifetime, you too are stepping into a world of possibility. This guide will be your companion on the journey, helping you navigate the landscape of bare metal validators, from the initial setup to maintaining a secure and reliable node.

**Welcome to the Baremetal Validators' Cone.** It’s time to take the first step on your journey to true decentralization. No more middlemen, no more third-party control—just you, your hardware, and the open road ahead. Are you ready to leave the Shire and make your mark on the blockchain?
