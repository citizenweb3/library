Web3 Society has a [Twitter account](https://x.com/W3_Society). All project ambassadors have access to the account and its management. 

The goal of developing the Twitter account is to grow the current fan base of Web3 Society, whether on Twitter, [Telegram](https://t.me/web_3_society) or any future communities it may manage. 

To help ambassadors to manage their work and attract like-minded people to follow Twitter, content should be posted regularly.

Here is a proposed, bi-weekly, content plan:

- Monday: Web3 economics
- Tuesday: DeAI / knowledge graphs 
- Wednesday: Cryptography / Coding lessons
- Thursday: Open hardware or open software news + retwit of cw3
