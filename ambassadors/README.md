## Web3 Society Ambassador program planning doc

UNDER DEVELOPMENT

### TL;DR 
At Citizen Web 3, we highlight a web3 without tribalism as our dream and goal, across various ecosystems within the blockchain space. Education, knowledge sharing and communication are essential to making that dream come true. As part of our project, Citizen Web3 decided to create `Web3 Society`: a place where tribalism isn't an issue. A place where anyone can share and find info about crypto technology, latest developments in consensus algorithms, DeAI news, 
open source hardware and software innovations, etc - without thinking of what token the information relates to. 

As part of Citizen Cosmos, we run an ambassador program for over 12 months. The programs goals weren't outlined and ambassadors were left acting at own discretion. Incentives were rewarded on a regular basis, once per month.  The goal of this document is to outline that community and outline incentives for its ambassadors. The main force carrying web3 values into the universe. Create dynamic rewards, outline goals and tasks that will benefit Citizen Web3 as a project.

### Goals:
- podcast shilling
- validator shilling
- validator info shilling
- web3 society telegram channel shilling 
- web3 society telegram content. Activity is more importnat here than anythign else.

### Web3 society ambassador incentives:
- Payment in tokens of availability end of month from one of CW3 validators nodes
- Make a vault with basket of tokens for validator available. Use for sponsoring paid activities by ambassadors + bonuses (future control via dao)
- Create second DeFi vault (dao control)
- % for delegators - how? Input a memo when delegating? Magic txs?
- bonuses for other activities (future merch or Decentraland activity) (help with giveaways, events, etc)
- Future DAO token bonuses
