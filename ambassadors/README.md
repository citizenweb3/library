# Web3 Society Ambassadors

## TL;DR 
We highlight the importance of such qualities as: lack of tribalism, meaningful education, knowledge sharing, communication, lack of enforcement - amongst the many, that are essential to making the dream of a decentralized, and a free web3, coming true. `Web3 Society`: is a community created by [Citizen Web3](https://www.citizenweb3.com/) to pursue that dream. A digital space where you can share and find information about crypto technology, latest developments in consensus algorithms, DeAI news, open source hardware, software innovations, memes and more. All without worrying to what token this information relates to.  

Our experience, gathered over the last decade of building communities in the crypto space, outlines the need for ambassadors and their incentives, for the successful development of any good degen community. They are truly, the main force carrying web3 values into the universe, which in turn, helps to shape Citizen Web3 as a project, while achieving the mission to carry good into the web3 space.
